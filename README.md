Developed an interactive dashboard for the Call Centre Analysis as part of my internship at PwC Switzerland. The dashboard provides valuable insights into call volume, response times, and agent performance, contributing to process optimization and enhanced customer satisfaction.

Key Features:

KPI Tracking: Monitored crucial KPIs such as average call handling time, customer satisfaction (CSAT%), and first-call resolution rates.
Data Visualization: Utilized Power BI to create visualizations that identify trends in customer inquiries, leading to actionable insights.
Real-Time Insights: Implemented real-time dashboards, improving call center performance monitoring by 30%.
Results: Achieved a 20% reduction in average call handling time and a 15% increase in first-call resolutions.
